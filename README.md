Publication Scraper for UTRC Reports
====================================

This tool is designed to pull publication information associated with a given
author, institution, and date range.

Right now we are just defining requirements. The existing code in here is for 
demonstration and is not meant to represent the code we are working toward.

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements
$ python3 pubmed_api.py -n 'William J Allen'
```
